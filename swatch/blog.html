                <p>Maybe you know you want something amazing, but you are unsure about ideas.
                     I am starting a blog where I talk about different ideas and concepts around events. Here is my first post. There are also my past events at the bottom.</p>

                        <h2>Greg and Beth</h2>
                        <p>Fortunately, being based in Utah we have the opportunity to utilize the wonderful mountains.
                            That is exactly what I helped Greg and Beth accomplish last year to make their dream wedding come true.
                            Beth and her friend had a good idea of what they wanted but had no idea how to bring it to life, so with
                            the full-package I worked hard to organize a place and plan a wedding they loved.

                        <p>Another fun event was for the reception of Tommy and Shannon.
                            They wanted a relatively low-scale reception, but wanted to make sure that it
                            was perfect for them and their guests.
                            We were able for a low price to make sure the event was a blast.</p>
