                <h1>Blog and Past Events</h1>
                <p>Maybe you know you want something amazing, but you are unsure about ideas.
                     I am starting a blog where I talk about different ideas and concepts around events. Here is my first post. There are also my past events at the bottom.</p>

                    <p>I was married in June 2020 when Covid was running the world.
                         So many things were unsure and my wedding definitely reflects that
                         . It was not at all like the wedding I always dreamed of.
                          Our immediate family were the only people present and we
                           live-streamed the ceremony on Facebook.
                            The weather building up to the big day 
                            was consistently bright, warm, and sunny…
                         but it rained for the first time in months on our day...</p>

                    <p>I want to be there for brides and grooms on their special day.
                         I want to make sure that they aren’t the ones running around
                          getting drenched from the rain of the day.
                         You go enjoy your day and let me handle the rest. </p>

                        <h2>Greg and Beth</h2>
                        <p>Fortunately, being based in Utah we have the opportunity to utilize the wonderful mountains.
                            That is exactly what I helped Greg and Beth accomplish last year to make their dream wedding come true.
                            Beth and her friend had a good idea of what they wanted but had no idea how to bring it to life, so with
                            the full-package I worked hard to organize a place and plan a wedding they loved.

                        <h2>Tommy and Shannon</h2>
                        <p>Another fun event was for the reception of Tommy and Shannon.
                            They wanted a relatively low-scale reception, but wanted to make sure that it
                            was perfect for them and their guests.
                            We were able for a low price to make sure the event was a blast.</p>
