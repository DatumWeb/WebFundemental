      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Would you like a personal experience with the wedding planner for your personal event? I would like to give my sister’s start up business a website platform.
           This site will contain information about Swatch Events and their services and make it appealing through the personalness. The site will provide potential clients with a good understanding of my sister and the effort she will put into her services.
           The website will give this brand-new company a professional and clean look that instils trust in the clients. There will be ways to contact the business and to select their services.]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[The primary audience of the service and the site is budget brides. This site would attract those who want low-stress and relatively small-scale receptions and weddings.
         There generally won't be many other vendors at these events. The style of these events will generally be an LDS style of reception.
         This is designed to help alleviate stress from the family member or friend who is helping plan the wedding/reception. Even though this is the main audience there are still options for larger-scale events.]</p>  <!-- change this -->

         “Memories with Swatch Events”
          Fortunately, being based in Utah we have the opportunity to utilize these wonderful mountains. That is exactly what I helped Greg and Beth accomplish last year to make their dream wedding. Beth and her friend wanted had a good idea of what they wanted but had no idea how to bring it to life so with the full package I worked hard to organize a place, and plan 

          Another fun event was for the reception of Tommy and Shannon. They wanted a relatively low scale reception, but they wanted to make sure it was perfect for them and for their guest. We were able for a low reasonable price to make sure the event was a blast.

        Let’s make the next incredible event yours!
