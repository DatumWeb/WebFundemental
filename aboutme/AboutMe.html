    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>I am Luke Hymas. I am from the suburbs of Denver and have lived there my whole life. I have 4 siblings. After this semester all of us will have gone or currently be on a mission. I served in the Milan Italy Mission. All of my older siblings live in Utah right now and I have one niece and one nephew. I am studying to be a Software Engineer major although at the moment I do not have very much knowlege in that area (guess that is why I am studying it). Since I don't know the industry all that well I am not sure what I will want to do with it but Cybersecurity sounds interesting to me.</p>
    <h2>What Do I Like To Do?</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy playing video games. Some of my favorites are The Binding of Isaac, Super Smash Bros, Red Dead Redemption 2, and of course, there are many others. I really enjoy Magic The Gathering, and generally play commander mode and use a group hug deck. I have played many sports growing up (and dislocated my knee 4 times) but my favorite sport is basketball and my favorite team is the Denver nuggets.</p>
