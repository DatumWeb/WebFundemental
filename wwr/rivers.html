                <h2>Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <div class="about-river">
                    <p class="mobile-yes">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
                        The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people
                        living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in
                        love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.</p>

                    <p class="mobile-no">Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn
                        sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring
                        ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter
                        from sun or rain when needed.</p>
                        
                    <p class="mobile-no">The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free
                        flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower,
                        and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children
                        who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                         You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.</p>

                    <p class="mobile-no">Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make
                         one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating
                          whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.</p>
                        
                    <p class="mobile-no">*The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated
                         I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most
                          people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>

                <div class="about-river">
                    <p class="mobile-yes">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere,
                         the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs,
                          beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs
                           from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
                            scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity,
                             and great whitewater opportunities.</p>

                    <p class="mobile-no">Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the uniqueness
                         and rich history that the canyon tells.
